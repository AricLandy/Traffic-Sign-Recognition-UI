# Traffic Sign UI
<traffic-sign-recognition.herokuapp.com>

This is a small UI for the traffic sign recognition program
it is built in react and deployed to Heroku


### Future Expansion
1. A more sophisticated confidence score (maybe I could send this from the API)
2. A way to upload images right from the internet
